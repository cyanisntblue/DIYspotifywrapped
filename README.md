# DIY Spotify Wrapped
Command line tool to display top artists, songs, and albums from a given year or of all time.

This Python program accepts only the downloadable "Spotify Extended Streaming History" which must be [requested from Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) and can take up to a month to be delivered.

### Requirements:
 - Your "Spotify Extended Streaming History" folder
 - `Numpy` and `Pandas` installed via pip

 ### Usage:
 1. Launch program either via IDE or terminal
 2. Drag and drop your folder onto the program to input the path (auto-discovered if program is executed from INSIDE the folder)
 3. Poke around your data! Enter the year you want to see or enter "all" for all time stats
 4. Select from top artists, top songs or top albums, and choose how many you'd like to display at once.
 5. Type "quit" when you're finished to exit
